678080271313432576,20118423,1,2015,12,19,5,princess tali demands to play kitty fetch. or else she will make sad crying noises.,1
678078379518595073,20118423,1,2015,12,19,5,they're all in my bed somewhere.,0
678077593870974977,20118423,1,2015,12,19,5,tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where i have none because she has lost most of them.,0

678058360168583168,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,you should carry yourself in a way as such. like you shouldn't change anything except how you think about yourself.,0
678058060825255937,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,"well the way i see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that, there's a possibility they do. fuck them. you are a person and-",1
678056997519007744,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,it could be. personally i think it looks awesome but different is treated differently by the public,0

678056191323336704,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,"seriously? if you don't mind me asking, why?",0
678055491705184256,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,we all have our coping mechanisms. and i think no human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.,0
678054560959565825,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,i bet. destroying men's concept of existence sounds so badass tbh.,0
678053408780095489,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,"ahh yes. i wasn't too good at messing with them, my trolling techniques are too uncreative. i'm sure you're a master at it.",0
678051755347877888,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,yeah after the 50thish one i was bored. it's like the same guy was messaging me from different accounts,1

678050140653883392,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,see that's why i left those sites years ago. i am a weird creepy guy magnet as well.,1
678049875569737728,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,oh god. that's terrifying.,1
678049676604538880,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing it for her,0
678049333183275009,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,well she just got done with finals. i think she's exercising pent up rage. it's hard being an engineering major apparently,1
678048632965345280,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,"she also ditches him frequently and ""accidentally"" shoots him. yet she won't change companions for some reason",0
678047952632328192,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,also everytime he complains about her hoarding she changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.,0
678047617146744832,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,yeah i vaguely remember him in fallout 3. it's been a few years but it's really recent for her. the memories are still fresh,0
678047318499700744,20118423,1,2015,12,19,3,i shudder at the thought of if she finds one even more ridiculous looking.,1
678039674481283072,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,i'm too nice to do that. such a shame.,0
678039493073502208,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,she's just incredibly tacky with looting and extorting caps. also underleveled like 70% of the time.,0
678038640606351362,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,"also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. push him off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc.",0
678038327195381760,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,"i should've taken a picture of the hat of shame, then.",0
678036723327098880,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,i have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it's amazing,0
678036107594883072,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,"also there's the fact that she makes maccready wear the ""hat of shame"" for ""being a turd in fallout 3""",0
678035808176111617,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,y'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games? she makes all of them because why not,0
678034974973534208,20118423,1,2015,12,19,2,i think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing it if not more.,0
